* `guilds`: with headers:

  * `guild_id`

## üèÉüèº Run

### Run without docker

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```

### Run with docker

You can either run with docker directly, or with docker-compose.

#### docker

```bash
docker run -d --env-file=.env bepolytech/ulbdiscordbot
```

#### docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To see the bot logs when running with docker in detached mode (`-d`), use the [docker logs for the container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/).

## üí† Bot usage

### ULB servers

* `/setup`

(Admin permission needed) When adding the bot to a new server, you need to set the @ULB role with the command `/setup`. This commande also allow you to choose if you want to force the registered membre to get rename with real name or not (yes by default).

* `/info`

(Admin permission needed) Get current server information (@ULB role, does rename is enable, and check for permission conflict).

* `/ulb`

Once the ULB role is set, when a new user join the server, either he is already registered (from another of yours server) in which case he will get the `@ULB` role and get rename, or he is not registered yet and will received a DM message with the instruction to register himself using `/ulb` command.

### Admin server

* `/user add`

Manually add an user (don't required email address to be verified)

* `/user info`

Get info about a registered user (discord id, ulb email, name and list of ulb guild that he is on)

* `/user edit`

Edit info of a user.

* `/user delete`

Delete an user.

* `/update`

This force a total update of the database and all the servers. Since the bot already do this automatically at startup and after each reconnection, the only normal usecase for this would be if you manually add an entry (server or user) to the google sheet instead of using the `/user add` command above.
