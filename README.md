## üèÉüèº Run

### Run without docker

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```

### Run with docker

```bash
docker run --env-file=.env ulbdiscordbot
```

## üí† Bot usage

* `/role setup`

When adding the bot to a new server, either the server follow the guild template given, and the role `@ULB` will get automatically set, or you can set it manually with the command `/role setup` (admin permission needed).

* `/email`

Once the ULB role is set, when a new user join the server, either he is already registered (from another of yours server) in which case he will get the `@ULB` role and get rename, or he is not registered yet and will received a DM message with the instruction to register himself using `/email` command.

* `/role update`

At any point, you can run `/role update` (admin permission needed) to check all the member of the server and add `@ULB` role and rename if the member is registered (usefull when adding the bot to a server that already contains registered users, or if you have manually added an user to the google sheet). ‚ö†Ô∏è That won't affect users that are not registered, so you can still add manually the `@ULB` role to someone to give him acces to only this server.
